Download the latest version of CSpect from http://www.cspect.org/ and unzip the contents here.

Note: Your virus checker may tell you that http://www.cspect.org contains harmful programs. This is incorrect:

    Note: I am aware most virus scanners are rejecting this. Apparently it's because I open files in "shared" read/write mode. 
    This is so that SD cards can still be written to while the emulator is running. You'll need to add an exception if you wish to use it.

If you do not wish to unzip the entire contents of CSpect then the minimal set of required files at of V2.13.00 are:

ay8912.dll
CSpect.exe
CSpectReadme.txt
i2C_Sample.dll
known_issues.txt
OpenAL32.dll
OpenTK.dll
OpenTK.dll.config
Plugin.dll
ReadMe.txt

Then download the DeZogPlugin.dll from https://github.com/maziac/DeZogPlugin (https://github.com/maziac/DeZogPlugin/releases) and place it here too

Ensure you download a version of the DeZogPlugin that is compatible with the version of CSpect you are using.
